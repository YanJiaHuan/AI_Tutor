    "Introduction": "Introduction Reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton and Barto, 1998) is intrinsically linked to \ufb01xed-point computation: the optimal value function is the \ufb01xed point of the (nonlinear) Bellman optimality operator, and the value function of a given policy is the \ufb01xed point of the related (linear) Bellman evaluation operator. Most of the time, these \ufb01xed points are computed recursively, by applying repeatedly the operator of interest. Notable exceptions are the evaluation step of policy iteration and the least-squares temporal di\ufb00erences (LSTD) algorithm1 (Bradtke and Barto, 1996). Anderson (1965) acceleration (also known as Anderson mixing, Pulay mixing, direct inversion on the iterative subspace or DIIS, among others2) is a method that allows speeding up the computation of such \ufb01xed points. The classic \ufb01xed-point iteration applies repeatdly the operator to the last estimate. Anderson acceleration considers the m previous estimates. Then, it searches for the point that has minimal residual within the subspace spanned by these estimates, and applies the operator to it. This approach has been successfully applied to \ufb01elds such as electronic structure computation or computational chemistry, but it has never been applied to dynamic programming or reinforcement learning, as far as we know. For more about Anderson acceleration, refer to Walker and Ni (2011), for example. 1. In the realm of deep RL, as far as we know, all \ufb01xed points are computed iteratively, there is no LSTD. 2. Anderson acceleration and variations have been rediscovered a number of times in various communities in the last 50 years. Walker and Ni (2011) provide a brief overview of these methods, and a close approach has been recently proposed in the machine learning community (Scieur et al., 2016). c\u20dd2018 Matthieu Geist and Bruno Scherrer.

Anderson Acceleration for Value Iteration In this section, we brie\ufb02y review Markov decision processes, value iteration, and show how Anderson acceleration can be used to speed up convergence. 2.1 Value Iteration Let \u2206X be the set of probability distributions over a \ufb01nite set X and Y X the set of applications from X to the set Y . By convention, all vectors are column vectors. A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a tuple {S, A, P, R, \u03b3}, where S is the \ufb01nite state space, A is the \ufb01nite action space, P \u2208 (\u2206S)S\u00d7A is the Markovian transition kernel (P(s\u2032|s, a) denotes the probability of transiting to s\u2032 when action a is applied in state s), R \u2208 RS\u00d7A is the bounded reward function (R(s, a) represents the local bene\ufb01t of doing action a in state s) and \u03b3 \u2208 (0, 1) is the discount factor. A stochastic policy \u03c0 \u2208 (\u2206A)S associates a distribution over actions to each state (deterministic policies being a special case of this). The policy-induced reward and transition kernels, R\u03c0 \u2208 RS and P\u03c0 \u2208 (\u2206S)S, are de\ufb01ned as R\u03c0(s) = E\u03c0(.|s)[R(s, A)] and P\u03c0(s\u2032|s) = E\u03c0(.|s)[P(s\u2032|s, A)]. The quality of a policy is quanti\ufb01ed by the associated value function v\u03c0 \u2208 RS: v\u03c0(s) = E[ \ufffd t\u22650 \u03b3tR\u03c0(St)|S0 = s, St+1 \u223c P\u03c0(.|St)]. The value v\u03c0 is the unique \ufb01xed point of the Bellman operator T\u03c0, de\ufb01ned as T\u03c0v = R\u03c0 + \u03b3P\u03c0v for any v \u2208 RS. Let de\ufb01ne the second Bellman operator T as, for any v \u2208 RS, Tv = max\u03c0\u2208(\u2206A)S T\u03c0v. This operator is a \u03b3-contraction (in supremum norm), so the iteration vk+1 = Tvk converges to its unique \ufb01xed-point v\u2217 = max\u03c0 v\u03c0, for any v0 \u2208 RS. This is the value iteration algorithm. 2.2 Accelerated Value Iteration Anderson acceleration is a method that aims at accelerating the computation of the \ufb01xed point of any operator. Here, we describe it considering the Bellman operator T, which provides an accelerated value iteration algorithm. Assume that estimates have been computed up to iteration k, and that in addition to vk the m previous estimates vk\u22121, . . . , vk\u2212m are known. The coe\ufb03cient vector \u03b1k+1 \u2208 Rm+1 is de\ufb01ned as follows: \u03b1k+1 = argmin \u03b1\u2208Rm+1 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd m \ufffd i=0 \u03b1i(Tvk\u2212m+i \u2212 vk\u2212m+i) \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd s.t. m \ufffd i=0 \u03b1i = 1. Notice that we don\u2019t impose a positivity condition on the coe\ufb03cients. We will consider practically the \u21132-norm for this problem, but it could be a di\ufb00erent norm (for example \u21131 or 2 Anderson Acceleration for Reinforcement Learning \u2113\u221e, in which case the optimization problem is a linear program). Then, the new estimate is given by: vk+1 = m \ufffd i=0 \u03b1k+1 i Tvk\u2212m+i. The resulting Anderson accelerated value iteration is summarized in Alg. 1. Notice that the solution to the optimization problem can be obtained analytically for the \u21132-norm, using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. With the notations of Alg. 1 and writting 1 \u2208 Rmk+1 the vector with all components equal to one, it is \u03b1k+1 = (\u2206\u22a4 k \u2206k)\u221211 1\u22a4(\u2206\u22a4 k \u2206k)\u221211. (1) This can be regularized to avoid ill-conditioning. Algorithm 1: Anderson Accelerated Value Iteration given: v0 and m \u2265 1 Compute v1 = Tv0; for k = 1, 2, 3 . . . do Set mk = min(m, k); Set \u2206k = [\u03b4k\u2212mk, . . . , \u03b4k] \u2208 RS\u00d7(m+1) with \u03b4i = Tvi \u2212 vi \u2208 RS; Solve min\u03b1\u2208Rm+1 \u2225\u2206k\u03b1\u2225 s.t. \ufffdmk i=0 \u03b1k = 1; Set vk+1 = \ufffdmk i=0 \u03b1iTvk\u2212mk+i; The rationale of this acceleration scheme is better understood with an a\ufb03ne operator. We consider here the Bellman evaluation operator T\u03c0. Given the current and the m previous estimates, de\ufb01ne \u02dcv\u03b1 k+1 = m \ufffd i=0 \u03b1ivk\u2212m+i with m \ufffd i=0 \u03b1i = 1. Thanks to this constraint, for an a\ufb03ne operator (here T\u03c0), we have that T\u03c0\u02dcv\u03b1 k+1 = m \ufffd i=0 \u03b1iT\u03c0vk\u2212m+i. Then, one searches for a vector \u03b1 (satisfying the constraint) that minimizes the residual \u2225T\u03c0\u02dcv\u03b1 k+1 \u2212 \u02dcv\u03b1 k+1\u2225 = \u2225 m \ufffd i=0 \u03b1i(T\u03c0vk\u2212m+i \u2212 vk\u2212m+i)\u2225. Eventually, the new estimate is obtained by applying the operator to the vector \u02dcv\u03b1 k+1 of minimal residual. The same approach can be applied (heuristically) to non-a\ufb03ne operators. The convergence of this scheme has been studied (e.g., Toth and Kelley (2015)) and it can be linked to quasi-Newton methods (Fang and Saad, 2009). 3 ",

    "Results": "Results We consider Garnet problems (Archibald et al., 1995; Bhatnagar et al., 2009). They are a class of randomly built MDPs meant to be totally abstract while remaining representative of the problems that might be encountered in practice. Here, a Garnet G(|S|, |A|, b) is speci\ufb01ed by the number of states, the number of actions and the branching factor. For each (s, a) couple, b di\ufb00erent next states are chosen randomly and the associated probabilities are set by randomly partitioning the unit interval. The reward is null, except for 10% of states where it is set to a random value, uniform in (1, 2). We generate 100 random MDPs G(100, 4, 3) and set \u03b3 to 0.99. For each MDP, we apply value iteration (denoted as m = 0 in the graphics) and Anderson accelerated value iteration for m ranging from 1 to 9. The inital value function v0 is always the null vector. We run all algorithms for 250 iterations, and measure the normalised error for algorithm alg at iteration k, \u2225v\u2217\u2212valg k \u22251 \u2225v\u2217\u22251 , where v\u2217 stands for the optimal value function of the considered MDP. 0 50 100 150 200 250 # of iterations 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 normalized error m = 0 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 m = 4 m = 5 m = 6 m = 7 m = 8 m = 9 a.

Normalized error (std, log-scale). Figure 1: Results on the Garnet problems. Fig. 1 shows the results. Fig. 1.a shows how the normalized error evolves with the number of iterations (recall that m = 0 stands for classic value iteration). Shaded areas correspond to standard deviations and lines to means (due to randomness of the MDPs, the algorithms being deterministic given the \ufb01xed initial value function). Fig. 1.b and 1.c show respectively the mean and the standard deviation of these errors, in a logarithmic scale. One can observe that Anderson acceleration consistently o\ufb00ers a signi\ufb01cant speed-up compared to value iteration, and that rather small values of m (m \u2248 5) seem to be enough. 2.4 Nuancing the Acceleration We must highlight that the optimal policy is the object of interest, the value function being only a proxy to it. Regarding the value function, its level is not that important, but its relative di\ufb00erences are. This is addressed by the relative value iteration algorithm (Puterman, 1994, Ch. 6.6). For a given state s0, it iterates as vk+ 1 2 = Tvk, vk+1 = vk+ 1 2 \u2212 vk+ 1 2 (s0)1. It usually converges much faster than value iteration (towards v\u2217 \u2212 v\u2217(s0)1), but the greedy policies resp. to each iterate\u2019s estimated values are the same for both algorithms. This scheme can also be easily accelerated with Anderson\u2019s approach. 4 Anderson Acceleration for Reinforcement Learning 0 2 4 6 8 10 # of iterations 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 100 normalized error (mean) m = 0 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 m = 4 m = 5 m = 6 m = 7 m = 8 m = 9 a. Error on greedy policies (accelerated VI). 0 50 100 150 200 250 # of iterations 10 12 10 10 10 8 10 6 10 4 10 2 100 normalized error (mean) m = 0 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 m = 4 m = 5 m = 6 m = 7 m = 8 m = 9 b. Normalized error (accelerated relative VI). 0 2 4 6 8 10 # of iterations 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 100 normalized error (mean) m = 0 m = 1 m = 2 m = 3 m = 4 m = 5 m = 6 m = 7 m = 8 m = 9 c. Error on greedy policies (accelerated relative VI). Figure 2: Additional results. We provide additional results on Fig. 2 (for the same MDPs as previously). Fig. 2.a shows the error of the greedy policy, that is \u2225v\u2217 \u2212 v\u03c0alg k \u22251/\u2225v\u2217\u22251, with \u03c0alg k being greedy respectively to valg k , for the \ufb01rst 10 iterations (same data as for Fig. 1). This is what we\u2019re really interested in. One can observe that value iteration provides more quickly better solutions than Anderson acceleration. This is due to the fact that if the level of the value function converges slowly, its relative di\ufb00erences converge more quickly. So, we compare relative value iteration and its accelerated counterpart in Fig. 2.b (normalized error of the estimate, not of the greedy policy), to be compared to Fig. 1.b. There is still an acceleration with Anderson, at least at the beginning, but the speed-up is much less than in Fig. 1. We compare the error on greedy policies for the same setting in Fig. 2.c, and all approaches perform equally well. 3. Anderson Acceleration for Reinforcement Learning So, the advantage of Anderson acceleration applied to exact value iteration on simple Garnet problems is not that clear. Yet, it could still be interesting for policy evaluation or in the approximate setting. We discuss brie\ufb02y its possible applications to (deep) RL. 3.1 Approximate Dynamic Programming Anderson acceleration could be applied to approximate dynamic programming and related methods. For example, the well-known DQN algorithm (Mnih et al., 2015) is nothing else than a (very smart) approximate value iteration approach. A state-action value function Q is estimated (rather than a value function), and this function is represented as a neural network. A target network Qk is maintained, and the Q-function is estimated by solving the least-squares problem (for the memory bu\ufb00er {(si, ai, ri, s\u2032 i)1\u2264i\u2264n}) 1 n n \ufffd i=1 (yi \u2212 Q\u03b8(si, ai))2 with yi = ri + \u03b3 max a\u2208A Qk(s\u2032 i, a). Anderson acceleration can be applied directly as follows. Assume that the m + 1 previous target networks Qk, . . . , Qk\u2212m are maintained. De\ufb01ne for k \u2212 m \u2264 j \u2264 k \u03b4j = [r1 + \u03b3 max a Qj(s\u2032 1, a) \u2212 Qj(s1, a1), . . . , rn + \u03b3 max a Qj(s\u2032 n, a) \u2212 Qj(sn, an)]\u22a4 \u2208 Rn 5 Geist and Scherrer and \u2206k = [\u03b4k\u2212m, . . . , \u03b4k] \u2208 Rn\u00d7(m+1). Solve \u03b1k+1 as in Eq. (1) and de\ufb01ne for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n yi = n \ufffd j=0 \u03b1j(ri + \u03b3 max a\u2208A Qk\u2212m+j(s\u2032 i, a)). So, Anderson acceleration would modify the targets in the regression problem, the necessary coe\ufb03cients being obtained with a cheap least-squares (given m is small enough, as suggested by our preliminary experiments). Notice that the estimate \u03b1k+1 is biased, as being the solution to a residual problem with sampled transitions. However, if a problem, this could probably be handled with instrumental variables, giving an LSTD-like algorithm (Bradtke and Barto, 1996). Variations of this general scheme could also be envisionned, for example by computing the \u03b1 vector on a subset of the memory replay or even on the current minibatch, or by considering variations of Anderson acceleration such as the one of Henderson and Varadhan (2018). This acceleration scheme could be more generally applied to approximate modi\ufb01ed policy iteration, or AMPI (Scherrer et al., 2015), that generalizes both approximate policy and value iterations. Modi\ufb01ed policy iteration is similar to policy iteration, except that instead of computing the \ufb01xed point in the evaluation step, the Bellman evaluation operator is applied p times (p = 1 gives value iteration, p = \u221e policy iteration), the improvement step (computing the greedy policy) being the same (up to possible approximation). In the approximate setting, the evaluation step is usually performed by performing the regression of p-step returns, but it could be done by applying repeatedly the evaluation operator, this being combined with Anderson acceleration (much like DQN, but with T\u03c0 instead of T). 3.2 Policy Optimization Another popular approach in reinforcement learning is policy optimization, or direct policy search (Deisenroth et al., 2013), that maximizes J(w) = ES\u223c\u00b5[v\u03c0w(S)] (or a proxy), for a user-de\ufb01ned state distribution \u00b5, over a class of parameterized policies. This is classically done by performing a gradient ascent: wk+1 = wk + \u03b7\u2207wJ(w)|w=wk. (2) This gradient is given by \u2207wJ(w) = ES\u223cd\u00b5,\u03c0w,A\u223c\u03c0[Q\u03c0w(S, A)\u2207w ln \u03c0w(A|S)]. Thus, it depends on the state-action value function of the current policy. This gradient can be estimated with rollouts, but it is quite common to estimate the Q-function itself. Related approaches are known as actor-critic methods (the actor being the policy, and the critic the Q-function). It is quite common to estimate the critic using a SARSA-like approach, especially in deep RL. In other words, the critic is estimated by applying repeatedly the Bellman evaluation operator. Therefore, Anderson acceleration could be applied, in the same spirit as what we described for DQN. Yet, Anderson acceleration could also be used to speed up the convergence of the policy. Consider the gradient ascent in Eq. (2). This can be seen as a \ufb01xed-point iteration to solve w = w+\u03b7\u2207wJ(w). Anderson acceleration could thus be used to speed it up. Seeing gradient descent as a \ufb01xed point is not new (Jung, 2017), nor is applying Anderson acceleration to speed it up (Scieur et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2018). Yet, it has never been applied to policy optimization, as far as we know. 6 ",
