    "Abstract": "Abstract The Epicurean Philosophy is commonly thought as simplistic and hedonistic. Here I discuss how this is a misconception and explore its link to Reinforcement Learning. Based on the letters of Epicurus, I construct an objective function for hedonism which turns out to be equivalent of the Reinforcement Learning objective function when omitting the discount factor. I then discuss how Plato and Aristotle \u2019s views that can be also loosely linked to Reinforcement Learning, as well as their weaknesses in relationship to it. Finally, I emphasise the close a\ufb03nity of the Epicurean views and the Bellman equation. When we think of Greek Philosophy, for most this constitutes the names Plato and Aristotle. This is not a surprise given the depth and the amount of their work, which, for the largest part, remains intact till today. In the famous painting of Raphael, Plato and Aristotle are portrayed right in the middle, dominating the scene. It is hard to pay attention to the young man at the bottom left-hand corner, who is said to be the philosopher Epicurus. Epicurus is perhaps the most misunderstood philosopher of the Ancient world. Those who have heard his name before associate it with pleasure. Epicurus is commonly perceived as a hedonist, as someone who only promoted the immediate pleasures of the \ufb02esh. This, however, is a super\ufb01cial and largely misleading presentation of his philosophy. Born in the island of Samos in 341BC [1, 2], also birthplace of the famous mathematician Pythagoras, Epicurus consequently lived in Athens, Lesbos, and Asia Minor. He was aware of the Aristotelian philosophy, which was a mainstream philosophical movement at the time, however he was dissatis\ufb01ed with this view of the world and adopted instead the earlier view of Democritus: \u00ab\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1f70\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f45\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u1f00\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd, \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b4\u0384 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9\u00bb [3] \u201cThe beginning of everything are atoms and space, everything else is in your mind.\u201d Much of his philosophy builds upon the philosophy of Democritus, complementing ideas that Aristotle had vigorously criticised. With his views not being very popular in Athens, where the Aristotelian philosophers dominated, Epicurus moved to Lesbos. However, his philosophy was again not accepted; even worse Epicurus was accused of serious crimes and had to escape leaving the island in stormy weather, to reach the Asia Minor coast. At the time, there were several Greek cities-colonies in Asia Minor. These cities were considered more progressive than the mainland cities; a suitable environment for the Philosophy of Epicurus. For instance it was not uncommon for the women of the colonies to get an education, in fact Asia Minor was the birthplace of many famous hetairas who are remembered by history. Hetairas are thought to be highly educated, high-end courtesans, companions of philosophers. One such example is the eminent Aspasia of Miletus, companion of Pericles who was the most renowned Athenian leader in the 5th BC century, the golden age of the Ancient Greek world. Aspasia is said to have written Pericles\u2019 most inspiring speeches. If there was any place in the Ancient world that could have accepted the revolutionary Epicurean philosophy, this was Asia Minor. Indeed Epicurus established a famous school in the city of Lampsacus [1] which, similar to the school of Pythagoras, accepted women and slaves among the students, something unacceptable at the elitist schools of Athens at the time. To put the matter in some perspective, Girton College in Cambridge was established as late as 1869AC to accept female students [4]. Epicurus, similar to Pythagoras, accepted students based on merit, not gender or status. He was even accused of praising his female student Themista, wife of Leonteus more than worthy male philosophers. Themista, according to one source [1], had previously been a hetaira. In 307BC, Epicurus, having gathered several followers returned once again in Athens, where he died in his early 70s [1, 2]. The world of Epicurus, similar to Democritus, consists of a world of interacting atoms, which account for the perceived properties of bodies. According to Epicurus, perception can be explained based on the \u201cinteraction of atoms with the sense-organs\u201d [5]. He added to the atomist theory the notion that \u201call perception is true\u201d and that we can learn to pursue natural pleasures rather than misleading desires 1 imposed by society [2]. This view is much compatible to the general framework of Reinforcement Learning, where an agent interacts with its environment and receives feedback from it. It is re\ufb02ected even closer by a most elaborated version of the agent-environment interaction proposed by Andy Barto and colleagues [6], according which the external world provides \u201csensations\u201d, that are internally interpreted by the agent (or organism) as reward signals, and that together with the perceived internal states will lead to decisions and actions. In the Epicurean philosophy, there is a clear mapping of good as pleasure, or in the Reinforcement Learning terminology positive reward, and evil as pain, or negative reward, punishment. There is also a clearly de\ufb01ned objective function: \u00ab...\u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f21\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1f74\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b6\u1fc6\u03bd\u00bb [7] \u201cWe say that pleasure is the beginning and the end of a happy life\u201d, Epicurus states in his letter to Menoeceus [8]. However, pleasure in the Epicurean philosophy does not merely have the notion of an immediate reward, as perhaps misinterpreted by the critics (or the followers!) of Epicurus. Instead, it has the notion of a function to be maximised given future rewards or punishments, as the consequence of present actions. In the simplest form, we can write pleasure as a function R, parametrised by time t, which consist of a \ufb01nite series of rewards of the future r at time t+1, t+2, t+3...T: Rt = rt+1 + rt+2 + rt+3 + . . . + rT As in Reinforcement Learning [9], the reward r, in this context, can be positive, zero or negative, capturing also potential neutral or negative e\ufb00ects of an action. According to Epicurus, choices of actions depend on future long-lasting pleasures: \u201cFor we know pleasure as our \ufb01rst and inborn good, and we have it as the beginning of our every choice and avoidance, and we turn to it in using sensation as a standard for judging every good. And since pleasure is our \ufb01rst and natural good, for this reason we do not choose every pleasure, but there are times when we pass over many pleasures, when greater di\ufb03culty would result from them for us, and we consider many pains to be better than pleasures, whenever a greater and long-lasting pleasure will follow for us after we have su\ufb00ered the pains. So every pleasure is a good through being naturally agreeable, nevertheless not every pleasure is to be chosen; just as it is also the case that every pain is bad, but not every pain is always by its nature to be avoided.\u201d (Translation taken from [8]). In this context, the word \u201cpleasure\u201d has two di\ufb00erent meanings, one referring to immediate pleasures (or pains), and one referring to the general concept of pleasure, the objective function that is captured by Rt. In the same letter, the Philosopher o\ufb00ers advices regarding the future consequences of the present actions. This is equivalent of thinking that the Philosopher has obtained, by his experience and observation, the state-action values Q(s,a) de\ufb01ned in Temporal-Di\ufb00erence Reinforcement Learning, which expresses the total reward that can be collected by an agent in state s when taking action a. This prior knowledge of the Q-values might save others the time and e\ufb00ort that would be required to discover if an action is bene\ufb01cial or harmful for their \u201csouls\u201d, or which types of pleasure should be pursued: \u201cFor continual drinking and partying, or taking one\u2019s enjoyment of boys and women [...] do not produce a pleasant life, but sober reasoning which both examines the basis for every choice and avoidance and drives out the opinions which cause very great turmoil to take hold of our souls.\u201d (Translation taken from [8]). This is precisely the turning point for all the presumed ideas of a simplistic hedonism in the Epicurean philosophy. It is not just the pleasure of now that one has to be concerned with, but its future consequences. Drinking, for instance, would have an immediate positive reward at time t+1 but a negative reward at some other time in the future (i.e., hangover!). In general, the values of the actions in the Epicurean Philosophy seem independent of the state of the agent, as they capture rather general concepts. For instance, Epicurus valued friendship beyond other pleasures and advised against pursuing romantic love too much as this often brings jealousy and pain in the long run. Considering friendship investment as an action, its value is independent of the state of the agent (human) and higher than the value of the action of pursuing romantic love. In fact, to the best of my knowledge, Epicurus never got married. He lived a long life, and a happy one to the end, despite the di\ufb03culties that he faced. Epicurus, in his letters, advised that death is nothing to be afraid of as when we are here, death is not present, and when death is present, we do not exist [8]. The evaluation of an action based on the addition of the consequent punishments and rewards is not unique in the Epicurean philosophy. Plato had earlier suggested much the same. In Protagoras, Socrates argues: \u201cThen your idea of evil is pain, and of good is pleasure. Even enjoying yourself you call evil whenever it leads to the loss of a pleasure greater than its own, or lays up pains that outweigh its pleasures.\u201d (Translation taken from [10]) Further in the text, however, Socrates claims that it is di\ufb03cult to measure good and evil, it requires a special skill, an art or science, and Protagoras agrees with 2 ",
