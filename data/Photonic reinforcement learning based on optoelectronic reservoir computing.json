However, the \ncomputational cost of reinforcement learning with deep neural networks is extremely high and reducing the learning cost \nis a challenging issue. We propose a photonic on-line implementation of reinforcement learning using optoelectronic delay-\nbased reservoir computing, both experimentally and numerically. In the proposed scheme, we accelerate reinforcement \nlearning at a rate of several megahertz because there is no required learning process for the internal connection weights in \nreservoir computing. We perform two benchmark tasks, CartPole-v0 and MountanCar-v0 tasks, to evaluate the proposed \nscheme. Our results represent the first hardware implementation of reinforcement learning based on photonic reservoir \ncomputing and pave the way for fast and efficient reinforcement learning as a novel photonic accelerator. \n \n \n \n \n",
