    "Introduction": "INTRODUCTION Artifcial intelligence is playing role everywhere - banking, education, healthcare, services and almost every important sector. One of the key reason behind its success is conversational AI which has not only led us from typing commands to speaking while we are doing some other activity but also given us personal assistants which are almost humanlike in their speeches. Conversational AI will help us solve problems like language formation, context sensitive conversations, translation, beter identifcation and other aspects which make the intelligent assistants more human-like. We have at our hand natural language processing, speech recognition, machine learning, neural networks, deep learning and other domains to transform the way we perceive artifcial intelligence. Deep/Hierarchical Learning is a subset of machine learning. It includes various architectures and neural networks which work on the information given to it. It works on the principle of knowledge building. It also predicts or classifes whether the knowledge is relevant or falls into which category.

For computing world, computer machines that can play games excellently is always a topic of interest. In a breakthrough paper published by DeepMind (London based company), with the use of Deep reinforcement learning, automated Atari playing [1] was demonstrated. Afer around one month of this amazing work, the company DeepMind was bought by Google. Afer Google\u2019s entry in this feld, there is a lot of buzz about reinforcement learning in the feld of AI. A relatively recent success by Google is AlphaGo [2] (artifcial agent) who has won against the Go champion of the world. Basics of Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is related to three broad felds namely 1) Artifcial Intelligence, 2) animal psychology and 3) control theory. Te idea is to have a robot/person/animal/deep net who is trying to learn to navigate in an environment which is dynamic and uncertain. Te goal of the autonomous agent is to maximize a reward (see Figure 1) and generally, this reward is a quantitative entity (numeric). It is easy to understand this concept with the help of sports. In the case of Tennis, we can think about following actions of the virtual agent: serves, returns, volleys. Te state of the game depends upon the smart selection of these actions. Here, the goal is to perform series of actions in order to win a point, game, set as well as match. So this numeric reward is always being considered by the virtual agent. Te objective of the agent is to implement a strategy or a set of strategies in order to get best possible score. In other words, the objective is to maximize the scoring function of the game. Here the issue is: the state of the game is not static. Depending upon the actions of agents the state will change rapidly which makes such type of modeling very tricky. Input for this type of model is the present state of the game as well as an action and it is supposed to generate the best possible value for scoring function as an output. But this scheme is just for one step whereas the overall objective is to win the game. Terefore the agent has to consider all the actions from the current state to the possible fnal state. Terefore, this modeling approach is highly application dependent since for each application the scoring function will be diferent. So one cannot arXiv:1709.05067v1  [cs.AI]  15 Sep 2017 use the same strategy which is used in building of Tennis agent for Chess agent and vice versa. 1 Figure 1: Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent (1) Early Models of DRL In the case of Atari agent, convolutional neural network (with a lot of adjustments) was build by researchers with the help of Atari screenshots. Te scoring function was dependent upon a target number (maximum possible reward) not a class. Another model is Deep Q-Network which is also known by DQN and again this is a contribution from Google [3]. It uses the same underlying principle: to maximize the reward points with the given state and action. DQN ofers improvements including but not limited to Experience Relay, Dueling Network Architecture. Reinforcement learning vs Supervised Learning Reinforcement learning is not at all rewording of supervised learning. In the case of supervised learning, the historical examples are used in order to understand the environment but this approach does not necessarily the best. Consider the example of a car driving in heavy trafc to understand diferences. In the case of supervised learning, the idea is to use the past data (let\u2019s say 2 weeks before) in order to establish road paterns and use those paterns in the current scenario. But here the problem is it may possible that 2 weeks before, the roads were very clear in terms of trafc and today in a heavy trafc scenario, the available information is not that much useful and there is no efective way to use it in order to obtain best results. Whereas, in the case of reinforcement learning, the focus is on rewards. Te driver will get points for his/her action. Actions like maintaining speed of the vehicle less than the speed limit, lane driving, proper signaling as and when required etc. Negative points are given for undesirable actions like speeding and tailgating. Here the objective function is to maximize the points and input is the current state of the trafc and action. Reinforcement learning focuses more on a change of the current state of the environment afer each action and supervised learning models don\u2019t consider it. 1 Source: htps://ai2-s2-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fgures/2016-1108/ec4a764e062153c911097495c7e4b7e93612b75d/2-Figure1-1.png 2 Figure 2: Summary of Reinforcement Learning (2) 2.1 Study of Challenges in Reinforcement Learning in Conversational AI Domain Detailed study of reinforcement learning is beyond the scope of this paper. So, instead of discussing mathematical equations or algorithms, we focus on challenges associated with reinforcement problems. Background: Reward Functions Te reward functions provide a signal/feedback which is an indicator of the performance of the system with respect to the underlying action. Tey also indicate the importance of each action by considering value addition by each action towards achieving the fnal goal/solution. Supervised learning actually indicates which type of action is correct and should be taken by user whereas in the case of reinforcement learning, the only signal is given depending upon how good/bad the action is for achieving overall goal. Tere is no notion of correctness of local actions. Tere are two diferent ways to defne reward functions for conversational AI: 1) Sparse functions 2) Non-sparse functions. Sparse functions are easy to design/defne but very hard to solve whereas non-sparse functions are difcult to design but very easy to solve. In the case of sparse functions there is no signaling mechanism i.e. the user won\u2019t get feedback for his local choices and at terminal stage only, he/she will get information about whether the desired output is achieved or not. For example, consider sparse function defned for playing chess, where no feedback is given for local actions (moves) but towards the end of the game the user gets information about whether he/she has achieved the goal (winning the game) or not. In the case of a non-sparse function, depending on the usefulness of the function in achieving the fnal desired objective, signals are provided to the user. So that the user can drive the system for achieving an overall optimal solution. 2 Source: htps://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b135e50fd568eac846f112ee8a0a1bbc 2 We can make an analogy between the success of companies with rewards. Traditional conventional approach for most of the companies is to achieve fnite limited rewards (profts) with known odds whereas other companies like Amazon wants to achieve out-sized massive rewards at long odds. Te later type of companies prefer exploration of new possibilities. In the case of reinforcement learning, the idea is to select one path which gives the maximum value of expected reward by exploring trade-of between exploitation and exploration. It may possible that a company gets a massive success afer a long string of failures and the same thing is possible for rewards too. Terefore one can\u2019t ignore exploration part. Summary of reinforcement learning model is shown in Figure 2. Key Challenges: Challenge 1: Multiple goals in the case of conversational AI Tere are several objectives of a conversational AI including 1) Robust performance 2) Meaningful /informative interaction with the user 3) Provide excellent user experience 4) Ofer personalization. So naturally, in the case of conversational AI, single reward function is not sufcient. Te next challenge is how to assign weights to these goals/objectives? i.e. how much importance should be given to each of the desired objectives. In summary, it is hard to design reward function which include these many challenges with appropriate weights. Challenge 2: Trade-of between various goals Te next challenge is to handle trade-of between the goals. For example, it is difcult to ofer extreme personalization as well as efcient performance for all the messages for a conversational AI. So how to achieve optimal behavior in this scenario? According to us, designing a weighting scheme in order to combine several goals is the biggest challenge for conversational AI since most of the goals of conversational AI are depending upon users\u2019 experience which is difcult to quantify. Some type of automated negotiation between diferent goals is desirable using which it may possible to combine several objectives in a single way(action). But again, trading between diferent goals while considering the underlying environment is a very hard task. In the conversational AI there is also trade-of in generating dialogue between 1) length of dialogue 2) Diversity of dialogue and again 3) personalization. Challenge 3: Coherent dialogue design Te agent should generate consistent response while generating answer for semantically identical input. For example, if a user ask question like \u201dWhere do you live now?\u201d and \u201dIn which country do you live now?\u201d he/she wants the same answer in both the cases. Tis problem looks simple but it is difcult to implement since the underling model should also generate linguistic plausible answer. Here, training data is huge and it consists data from multiple diferent users. A Persona-Based Neural Conversation Model is making frst steps into the direction of explicitly modelling a personality [6]. Challenge 4: Evaluate conversational agents We can evaluate conversational agent by both subjective and objective evaluation technique. Te subjective evaluation technique considers users\u2019 experiences of diferent aspects of the conversations, while the objective evaluation technique are based on an analysis of the logs of the actual conversations. Tese evaluation methods are well described in the literature [11]. Reward function can send feedback to agent based on this evaluation. Evaluation of conversational agents depends upon quantitative as well as qualitative features and most of the qualitative features are user dependent. Terefore, we feel that extreme personalization and universal defned metrics for qualitative features are the biggest challenges for evaluation of conversational agents. 2.2 Deep Reinforcement Learning based Conversational Models Deep reinforcement learning is emerging area for development of conversational models [7]. Idea is to learn conversational patern via trial and error method. Such training is performed via clients or a dialogue set predefned in computers. A huge dataset is required to train the deep neural network and so automatic chatbot algorithms are applied for training. For providing such training Bayesian models, Markov models, etc. have been developed. It is a great challenge to be able to model such algorithms which are accurate enough to train the reinforcement networks which includes gathering of relevant and sometimes specifcally irrelavant dataset, semantics,etc. While following a statistical approach. To model dynamic training algorithm, human clients with enough knowledge and clarity of purpose or intelligent enough AI devices/algorithms are required which is a problem we face currently. Te above mentioned sequence to sequence model is able to generate dialogues given a conversation and context pre hand based on maximum likelihood estimation but it generates a very high amount of responses which in a way means that the intelligent agent is unable to answer. Tis model works on reward and punishment strategy like any other reinforcement model unlike MLE which helps in building long conversational training and learning for the AI assistant. Supervised learning in AlphaGo style strategy and optimisation techniques are also applied for the achievement. By using large data and computing resources, the rise of deep reinforcement learning has boosted our ability to build computational models which are applicable in our lives. Te AI bots built with Deep Reinforcement Learning understand the semantics of all domains and are capable of scaling. Tis advancement allows us to solve dialogue problems in various domains. Te behaviour based on random, rule-based and supervision based learning outperformed by DRL based learned policies. A report of experiments concludes that the DRL-based policy has a 53% win rate versus 3 automated players, whereas a supervised player trained on a dialogue corpus in this seting achieved only 27%, versus the same 3 bots [10]. Te above results prove that DRL is a reliable framework for training dialogue systems and strategic agents with negotiation abilities. Te experimental results report that all DRL agents substantially outperform all the baseline agents. 2.3 Deep Learning based Conversational Models Deep learning along with other emerging areas has greatly impacted the way we perceive artifcial intelligence. With context to development of conversational artifcial intelligence, deep learning has been able to make great leaps. Evolution of deep learning [9] is shown in Figure 3. 3 ",
