A viable solution to deal with the sparsity of rewards is to learn via intrinsic motivation which advocates for adding an intrinsic reward to the reward function to encourage the agent to explore the environment and expand the sample space. Though intrinsic motivation methods are widely used to improve data-ef\ufb01cient learning in the reinforcement learning model, they also suffer from the so-called detachment problem.

    "Introduction": "Introduction In a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task, an agent learns from the feedback given by the environment. In contrast to other paradigms of machine learning, an advantage of using reinforcement learning is the ability to solve complex learning tasks without expert domain knowledge. Particularly, in multi-agent reinforcement learning, the agent often operates in a complex environment. For instance, Li et al. (2020) consider the problem of learning an optimal courier dispatching policy in a multi-agent dynamic environment. A reinforcement learning problem is typically modeled using a Markov decision process (MDP) (Kaelbling et al., 1996; Sutton & Barto, 2018). An MDP is de\ufb01ned by a tuple that is formed by the state set, the action set, the transition function, and the reward function. The state set and the action set are typically assumed to be known to the agent while the transition function and the reward function are unknown to the agent. When an agent takes a particular action in a particular state, it receives a reward given by the 1Eindhoven University of Technology. Correspondence to: Jiong Li <j.li11@student.tue.nl>, Pratik Gajane <p.gajane@tue.nl>. reward function and the environment transitions to a state given by the transition function. In a reinforcement learning problem, the learning goal is formalized as the outcome of maximizing the obtained cumulative reward. In order to maximize the cumulative reward, a reinforcement learning agent faces a signi\ufb01cant challenge known in the literature as the exploration-exploitation dilemma. An agent may choose actions tried in the past and found to be rewarding (i.e. exploitation) or it may choose unexplored actions to see if they are more rewarding (i.e. exploration). Without suf\ufb01cient exploration, an agent might not be able to \ufb01nd the optimal solution to the reinforcement learning problem. On the other hand, excessive exploration does not contribute to the goal of maximizing the cumulative reward and hence it represents sample-inef\ufb01ciency. Thus, the ability to ef\ufb01ciently explore the environment remains key to sample-ef\ufb01cient reinforcement learning. Exploration in reinforcement learning is often driven via rewards and hence the density of rewards in the environment signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uences the ef\ufb01ciency and thus sustainability of the model. The ef\ufb01ciency is presented by the training time of the model and the execution time to achieve certain goals. Sustainability measures the feasible range of the model. Sparsity in the neural networks might improve the learning ef\ufb01ciency, however, a sparse-reward environment severely reduces the ef\ufb01ciency and sustainability of most reinforcement learning algorithms. Consequently, the sparsity of rewards diminishes the applicability of reinforcement learning to real-life problems as shown by Wu et al. (2020). A feasible solution to this problem is to improve the exploration ef\ufb01ciency to get as much reward as possible. For example, a solution known as reward shaping uses some simulated positive rewards in the environment to encourage more exploration of the actual rewards from the interaction with the environment. However, reward shaping is sensitive to the reward density in a sparse-reward environment. Another possible solution is to apply intrinsic motivation techniques during the learning process. Intrinsic motivation rewards the agent for exploring new states via an intrinsic reward. As explained in Andres et al. (2022), there are four approaches to achieve intrinsic motivation \u2013 1) count-based, 2) prediction-error, 3) random network distillation, and 4) rewarding impact-driven exploration. These methods are able to improve exploration in most cases, though they also arXiv:2302.10825v1  [cs.AI]  21 Feb 2023 ",
    "Related Work": "Related Work The sparse-reward environment is commonly encountered in real-world applications, especially in multi-agent reinforcement learning problems. Using intrinsic motivation shows a signi\ufb01cant improvement in improving the sample ef\ufb01ciency in sparse-reward environments, for instance training a grandmaster in StarCraft (Vinyals et al., 2019), training the defensive escort team (Sheikh & B\u00a8ol\u00a8oni, 2020) etc. However, as Delos Reyes et al. (2022) demonstrated, exploration using ICM suffers from problems like detachment and inadequate exploration quality when used with limited observations. Burda et al. (2018) also show that random network distillation (RND), another intrinsic motivated method, is suf\ufb01cient to motivate the agent to explore ef\ufb01ciently in a short-term decision process, though it has a lower performance in a long-term goal. For instance, Burda et al. (2018) consider Montezuma\u2019s Revenge. Montezuma\u2019s Revenge is an atari game in which the agent tries to collect useful items to escape with some actions, like jumping, running, sliding down poles, and climbing chains and ladders. However, the agent might get stuck if it focuses on short-term rewards (like collecting the items or \ufb01ghting with enemies) but moves away from the exit door. RND can help the agent to get the key, however, it does not realize that the key should be saved in a long-term strategy due to the limitation of the key. Another solution is proposed in Hester et al. (2018) which applied the pre-training with demonstration data to expand the replay buffer. The improved experiment results in the same environment, Montezuma\u2019s Revenge, indicate that expanding the replay buffer might alleviate the detachment and derailment issue. However, collecting the domain knowledge and generating demonstration data requires extra knowledge of each experiment environment which might be unavailable or not conveniently attainable. Go-Explore (Ecoffet et al., 2021) is another method which aims to increase the ef\ufb01ciency of exploration. However, Go-Explore is more fragile in the multi-agent environment due to its complexity. In this article, we propose to combine the features of Go-Explore and the ICM framework with the aim of solving detachment and derailment issues. ",
    "Problem Formulation": "Problem Formulation We design a decentralized partially observable environment involving multiple agents to simulate the real-world environment. The naive ICM method and the improved ICM method are implemented on a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. To quantify the improvement, we design a complicated sparse-reward environment in which a few speci\ufb01c states result in positive rewards. By comparing the total reward of our proposed method, I-Go-Explore, with the total reward of the baseline naive ICM method, we showcase the performance improvement of the proposed method. We use the formulation of a partially observable Markov game to represent a multi-agent Markov game. A partially observable Markov game is described with the following quantities : \u2022 n agents. \u2022 The public state space S. \u2022 The action space for each agent, denoted as A1, ...An. \u2022 The observation space for each agent, denoted as Oi, ..., On. \u2022 The stochastic policy for each agent as \u03c0i : Oi \u00d7Ai \u2192 [0, 1]. The next state is produced by the current state and joint action from each agent i.e., T : S \u00d7 Ai \u00d7 ... \u00d7 An \u2192 S. \u2022 The reward function for each agent is ri : S \u00d7 Ai \u2192 R, then the agent i arrives at a private observed state oi : S \u2192 Oi and the private observation space is O = o1, ..., on. \u2022 The deterministic policies for each agent as \u00b5Oi \u2192 Ai and the deterministic policy space is \u00b5 = \u00b51, ..., \u00b5n. \u2022 The policy parameters for each agent are \u03b8i and the policy parameters\u2019 space is \u0398 = \u03b81, ..., \u03b8n. And the policy is represented by its parameters: \u03c0i \u2192 \u03b8i. \u2022 The action-state value function for each agent is calculated using the private observation space and the joint actions during the centralized training i.e., Q\u00b5 i : O, a1, ..., an where a1 \u2208 Ai, ...an \u2208 An. Each Q\u00b5 i is independent. 3. ",
    "Methodology": "Methodology In this section, we describe the methodology used in our article. 3.1. Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) The MADDPG algorithm performs centralized training and decentralized execution to accelerate the training process using an actor-critic algorithm (Konda & Tsitsiklis, 1999). Since this algorithm is extended from Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), the parameters of the policy are optimized by the gradient descent method. As for the actor-critic framework, the actor network achieves the decentralized execution which independently optimizes the policy only with self-observed information. The actor network for each agent applies the policy gradient to maximize the expected reward signals and the optimization process of the policy is achieved by the gradient of the expected reward signals for each agent as: \u2207\u03b8iJ (\u03b8i) = EO,a D[\u2207aiQ\u00b5 i (O, a1, ..., an)\u2207\u03b8i\u00b5i(oi)|ai=\u00b5\u03b8i(oi)] where Q\u00b5 i (O, a1, ..., an) is the decentralized action-value function for agent i, and D is the experience replace buffer which contains the samples of trajectory at each episode. As for the critic network for each agent, it achieves centralized training where it gathers all the information from each agent and evaluates the quality of the policy from the actor network. The loss function used in the critic network is: L(\u03b8i) = EO,a1,...,an,r1,...,rn,O\u2032[Q\u00b5 i (O, a1, ..., an) \u2212 y)2] y = ri + \u03b3Q\u00b5\u2032 i (O\u2032, a1, ..., an, r1, ..., rn) where y is the true reward signal from the next state and \u00b5\u2032 is the target policy. However, in the general sum game, each agent will make a trade-off between the maximization of individual reward and the maximization of team reward. With this framework, centralized training and decentralized execution are implemented for the multi-agent Markov game. The reward function is designed based on the intrinsic motivation method to solve the sparse-reward issue. The structure of this framework is shown in Figure 1 and further details are discussed below. The \ufb01gure only illustrates the structure for a single agent and the other agents have the same structure. 3.2. Intrinsic Curiosity Module The ICM method (Pathak et al., 2017) motivates the agent to explore in multi-agent environment by giving an additional reward signal as an intrinsic reward. The intrinsic reward is the prediction error which is the difference between the predicted next state and the actual next state. The more disparate the prediction and the reality, the higher is the returned intrinsic reward. For the decentralized execution, each agent has a private intrinsic reward module. ICM is composed of three parts: encoder, forward model, and inverse model. ",

    "Results": "Results This article is extended based on the success of the ICM method in multi-agent reinforcement learning sparse reward Curiosity-driven Exploration in Sparse-reward Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Figure 2. The large black circles represent the landmark, the red circles are the predators and the green circle is the prey. environment and the success of Go-Explore in a singleagent sparse reward environment. The initial multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment implements Multi-agent Particle Environment (MPE) which is proposed in Lowe et al. (2017). This environment was created for MADDPG method and it contains several scenarios to test an algorithm\u2019s performance in a cooperative task 1. In the given experiments, the base model applies MADDPG as the learning algorithm so that each agent has an individual reward function. Based on MADDPG framework, we test the performance of our proposed solution I-Go-Explore against the baseline of ICM. In the MADDPG framework, each agent has its own actorcritic network and target actor-critic network which contains two-layer ReLU MLPs with 64 cells in each layer. The actor-critic network updates the parameters in each episode and the target actor-critic network applies the soft update function to optimize the parameters in a short time period. Usually, the learning rate of the critic network is slightly higher than the actor network\u2019s since the aim of the critic network is to evaluate the actor network. In the ICM method, the encoder has two ReLU MLPs with 64 cells in each layer, and the forward function and inverse both have one ReLU MLP with 64 cells in each layer. In the experiment, we applied the same environment as Lowe et al. (2017). Therefore, the basic parameters setup are following Lowe et al. (2017), except updating frequency for target network since the aim of this paper focuses on the performances of intrinsic motivation instead of optimizing MADDPG framework. The target network is updated every 10 steps 1The code used for the experiments will be made available via a Github repository on acceptance of this submission. during the training to alleviate the side effects of the partial observation environment. We conduct three sets of experiments to show that our proposed solution provides a promising improvement in the multi-agent environment. There are three predators, one prey and two landmarks (obstacles) in this chasing environment. The prey moves faster than the predator. The prey is punished for being caught or moving out of the vision border which is -1.0 to +1.0. The prey is easy to be caught by moving out of the border. The prey gets a punishment of -10 for each occurrence of the above two situations. The predators get rewards by catching the prey with +10 for each catch and they are not punished for moving out of the vision border. An illustration of this environment is shown in Figure 2. Each agent has an individual policy and a reward system to maximize the individual reward. A more optimal solution is for the predators to learn to cooperate to chase the prey which indicates the maximization of the total reward. The prey-predator is a two-dimensional environment and the state is presented by the positions of agents and landmarks, and the action is formed by \ufb01ve discrete moving directions. However, each agent has an observation limitation that only allows the agent to observe the partial environment within a circular area of radius 0.5. The aim of the \ufb01rst experiment is to observe the performances of both methods in terms of the reward of prey and predators and also the time-consumption. For the second experiment, we aim to compare the long-term training result with the short-term training result to analyze if I-GoExplore indicates a good effect on the long-term task. The third experiment focuses on the I-Go-Explore method which tests the performances with different exploration lengths to observe the impact of exploration length. The evaluation setting during the training for the three experiments is the same. We evaluate the rewards of each agent for every 5 episodes since the environment is stochastic and it would be more reasonable to evaluate average rewards for a batch of training episodes. There are training phases and test phases for the experiments. We trained the model according to the experiment settings and applied the trained model to the corresponding test environment. 4.1. Experiment 1 The aim of the \ufb01rst experiment is to observe the performances of both methods in terms of the reward of prey and predators and also the time-consumption. We trained the model for ICM and I-Go-Explore separately for 500 episodes with 100 steps in each episode. Then, we test the rewards of ICM model and the I-Go-Explore model in the prey-predator environment (different setting from the training) in 100 episodes with 100 steps in each episode. With Curiosity-driven Exploration in Sparse-reward Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Figure 3. The \ufb01gure compares the reward of prey and predators for 500 episodes with 100 steps in ICM method and I-Go-Explore method. the same parameter setups for the training process in ICM and I-Go-Explore, I-Go-Explore has higher average rewards during the test as shown in Figure 3. We took 50 steps (half the length of the episode) for the exploration phase in I-GoExplore method since the exploration information might help the sampling during the target network training and we do not want the impact of the exploration to be stronger than the actual training experience. Nevertheless, from the results shown in Figure 3, some outliers catch our attention, like the episode around 55 and the episode around 65. Recall that the prey is punished for getting caught while, predators are rewarded for catching the prey. These outliers indicate that the prey is easily caught by the predators in those episodes and policies for the predators are better. To con\ufb01rm our conjecture, we checked the images in this evaluation period and each image records the moves of each agent during the episode. Observing the image with the large negative prey reward shows that the prey always runs out of the borders to escape the predators and predators successfully move out of the borders to catch the prey. In the I-Go-Explore method, the prey and predators got 0 rewards. One possible explanation is that the prey has a larger velocity and it learns to escape the predators and keeps itself within the border. On the other hand, the predators are too slow to catch the prey even though they know how to move toward the prey. The average rewards for prey and predators under each method are shown in Table 1. From the average rewards, we observe that prey can avoid being caught while keeping itself within the borders in I-Go-Explore method. We conjecture that it bene\ufb01ted from the exploration so that the MADDPG model gave better guidance during the test. agent ICM I-Go-Explore prey -786.62 -268.83 predator (each) 16.76 8.88 Table 1. The average rewards for 500 episodes in two methods are shown in here. Figure 4. The \ufb01gure is the intrinsic reward for each agent. Agent 4 is the prey and the rest are the predators. We trained the model on Intel Core i5-8265 cpu with 8GB RAM and the go-explore ICM method took less training time (15805 seconds) than the ICM method (18005 seconds). 4.2. Experiment 2 To compare the impact of I-Go-Explore on long-term tasks from experiment 1, the training step in experiment 2 is 20 steps for each episode. Similar to the exploration performed in experiment 1, the exploration phase takes half the episode length which is 10 steps for go-explore ICM method. The total reward in two methods for 100 episodes with 20 steps is plotted in Figure 4. From the results, there is little difference between the two models in the test environment. Indeed, in the shorter steps of training, ICM method showed better performance in prey agent which is the opposite of longer steps of training. The average rewards of the short-term training and the long-term training for two methods are shown in Table 2. Also, there is little difference between the computation time of the two methods. 4.3. Experiment 3 In the last experiment, we compared the I-Go-Explore method with different exploration settings in 100 episodes of 100 steps each. The short-exploration model is trained with ",
