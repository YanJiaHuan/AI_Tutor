    "Abstract": "Abstract    Purpose    Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology is hindered chiefly by: 1) Requiring large annotated data  sets. 2) Non-generalizability that limits deployment to new scanners / institutions. And 3)  Inadequate explainability and interpretability, these being critical to foster the trust needed for  wider clinical adoption.     We believe that Reinforcement Learning can address all three shortcomings, with robust and  intuitive algorithms trainable on small datasets. We in fact feel that reinforcement learning will  help to usher radiology AI beyond its infancy and into true clinical applicability, while  broadening its research horizons. To the best of our knowledge, reinforcement learning has not  been directly applied to computer vision tasks for radiological images. In this proof-of-principle  work, we train a deep reinforcement learning network to predict brain tumor location.    Material and Methods    Using the BraTS brain tumor imaging database, we trained a deep Q network (DQN) on 70 postcontrast T1-weighted 2D image slices. We did so in concert with image exploration, with  rewards and punishments designed to localize lesions.     To compare with supervised deep learning, we trained a keypoint detection convolutional  neural network on the same 70 images. We applied both approaches to a separate 30 image  testing set.     Results    Reinforcement learning predictions consistently improved during training, whereas those of  supervised deep learning quickly diverged. Reinforcement learning predicted testing set lesion  locations with 85% accuracy, compared to roughly 7% accuracy for the supervised deep  network.     Conclusion    Reinforcement learning predicted lesions with high accuracy, which is unprecedented for such a  small training set. We have thus illustrated some its tremendous potential for radiology. Most  of the current radiology AI literature focuses on incremental improvements in supervised deep  learning. We believe that reinforcement learning can propel radiology AI well past this  inherently limited approach, with more clinician-driven research and finally toward true clinical  applicability.          Introduction    Over the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have gained traction and  ubiquity in radiology research. Indeed, the volume of research in this field has grown  exponentially (1\u20133).     However, significant hurdles remain, and the key to overcoming them may lie in areas of AI  hitherto unexplored in radiology. A 20,000-foot view of deep learning is in order: most  radiology AI up until now has been in the realm of supervised deep learning (SDL). In SDL, large  numbers of explicitly labeled data are used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  These trained networks can then make predictions on new unlabeled data, often classification,  semantic segmentation or localization tasks.     SDL is complemented by unsupervised deep learning, which seeks to cluster data without prelabeling by an imaging expert. The goal in unsupervised deep learning is to uncover  commonalities and differences in data, without overt data labeling or annotation. Unsupervised  deep learning is more of an exploratory procedure; typically, the researcher does not initially  know what s/he is looking for specifically, and no goal can be provided to the algorithm.  Unsupervised learning is a small but growing portion of the landscape (4,5). However, SDL  continues to constitute the vast majority of current radiology deep learning research.    SDL suffers from the following three major limitations:   1. It requires tremendous volumes of expertly hand annotated data, which is time-consuming  and tedious.   2. It is unstable in the sense of being exquisitely sensitive to even subtle differences in image  quality. Goodfellow et al. showed that adding just a small amount of imperceptible image noise  can throw off the predictions of SDL (6). As such, a network trained on a given patient  population with certain CT or MRI scanner settings at a particular institution in general fails to  perform acceptably well when deployed on a new scanner and/or different institution with  different patient population.   3. SDL suffers from a notorious \u201cblack box\u201d phenomenon (7,8). Gaining the trust of people,  particularly in a field as critical as health care, requires that the algorithms helping to make  decisions do so in a transparent manner. Understanding at least part of the rationale for why AI  algorithms make certain determinations fulfills this basic need of both patients and clinicians  that is required before widescale adoption is possible (9,10).     In our search to overcome these hurdles, we note that a third major field of AI research has  already produced astounding results in applications as varied as board games, automated video  game playing and robotics. This AI field is called reinforcement learning (RL), and it is the focus  of the present work. RL lies somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised deep learning,  yet is in important ways distinct from both (5). Notably, RL was a key contributor to AlphaGo\u2019s  victory over the European champion in the game of Go, a major breakthrough given the game\u2019s  inherent complexity (11). Additional advances that would have been unfeasible with supervised  or unsupervised approaches include world champion level autonomous video game playing  (12\u201314) and in the field of robotics (15,16).     RL can address the three aforementioned drawbacks of SDL:   1. The way RL learns about the environment / image includes much of what is not the desired  label or structure of interest. As such, many fewer labeled images are needed for RL to learn  enough to apply to new images.   2. Because of this learning of the \u201cnon-answer,\u201d as opposed to SDL\u2019s reliance on labeled correct  answers, RL is robust to inevitable noise and variations in image acquisition techniques and  patient populations. This has to do with how RL works; goals are not provided explicitly as in  SDL, but rather implicitly through a system of rewards. This process turns out to provide a more  robust and generalized kind of learning during training.   3. The reward system also provides vital intuition that is lacking in SDL. Reward structures  provide the rationale for why an algorithm makes certain predictions. It also opens  opportunities for imaging medical specialists such as radiologists and pathologists to exploit  their domain knowledge to help craft algorithms.     Despite the promise, RL has not as of yet, to the best of our knowledge, been applied directly to  computer vision in radiological / medical images. Coming closest, in the field of computer vision  more generally, Wang and Sarcar were able to accurately segment non-radiological images  using RL with simulated pen drawings (17).     We seek in this work to demonstrate proof-of-principle application of RL to radiology. Our  application is to detect brain tumors from 2D MRI images. This will lead to more sophisticated  implementations for image classification, object detection and segmentation. We believe that  RL will ultimately far exceed the accomplishments of SDL. We anticipate further that as RL in  radiology advances in subsequent work, it will finally begin to demonstrate, in a paradigmshifting manner, the truly enormous potential of AI to fundamentally improve the efficiency  and success of clinical image interpretation.     Before describing the application of RL to our detection problem, we very briefly introduce the  approach, starting with its history. RL gradually came into being through two disparate threads  of research: behavioral psychology and engineering control theory. The notion of rewards and  punishments engendering learning has a long history in psychology, originally formulated by  Thorndike in 1911 based on animal studies (18) as the \u201cLaw of Effect.\u201d Minsky (19) and Bellman  (20\u201322) provided the foundational control theory formulations in the 1950s. These two threads  coalesced during a revival of the field in the 1980s\u20131990s. It was in this era that most of the  modern RL concepts were developed by Barto and Sutton (23\u201327). More recently, the  introduction of deep convolutional neural networks has produced deep reinforcement learning  (DRL). The associated deep Q-networks (DQNs) provide functional approximations that can  ultimately allow for optimal actions to be taken. For example, an early success for DRL was  champion-level performance on Atari games (12) because it allowed for the autonomous gameplayer to select the optimal action at every step of the game based purely in pixelwise input.  We employ a DRL formulation in the present work.     Methods    Concepts and terms    In order to describe the method, we need to very briefly introduce some key concepts from  RL/DRL. We will do so in the context of our particular system and approach. For the interested  reader, much more detailed and didactic treatments of RL and DRL are available elsewhere, for  example the textbook by Barto and Sutto (28).     RL focuses on the process of learning from an environment (28,29). This type of learning is  guided by the experiences of an agent, which is able to take certain actions within the  environment. Depending on the action and particular state, the agent receives certain rewards.  Once one has specified the environment, states and possible actions, a careful selection of the  rewards can guide learning to fulfill a desired task. The goal of the algorithm, or agent, is to  achieve the maximum cumulative reward. This can be at the cost of short-term gains.    More formally defining our terms:  -Environment: This is the physical world in which the agent operates and with which it  interacts. In our case, the environment consists mostly of the 2D slice of a post-contrast T1weighted brain MRI containing a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) lesion. In order to make the  problem of finding this lesion more tractable, we add to our environment the set of (x,y)  positions looked at by a radiologist at an earlier time during simulated image interpretation, as  recorded by eye tracking hardware and software (30\u201334). This set of (x, y) coordinates within  the image is referred to as the gaze plot. Hence the full environment here is the 2D image with  overlaid gaze plot for that image.   -Agent: entity that takes actions in an environment and receives rewards. In our case the agent  is a moving point sitting on a pixel that we ultimately hope will land within the tumor, thereby  predicting its position.  -State: the state conveys the agent\u2019s current situation. In our case the state is where in the  image our point resides, i.e. on which pixel it is currently sitting. In order to decrease the state  space, or possible ways the point can move as it seeks to find the lesion, we restrict our agent  to move only along the gaze plot, i.e. among pixels that were looked at by the radiologist. The  assumption is that during the prior simulated image interpretation, the radiologist (JNS, with  two years of experience in neuroradiology) looked at the lesion at least once. Hence, by moving  along gaze points, which constitutes a one-dimensional space, the agent is certain to intersect  the lesion. How the agent can move between states is illustrated in Figure 1.   -Action: a change in the state. In our case, action is our point moving between pixels in the  image, more specifically between points on the gaze plot.  -Policy: the prescription for which action to take in a given state. The goal of RL/DRL training is  to produce an optimal policy. In our case, the optimal policy is for the agent to move toward  the tumor as quickly as possible and stay there to mark / predict that lesion.  -Value: the cumulative future reward that the agent receives by taking a given action in a  particular state. In our system, moving toward the lesion has high value, whereas moving away  from it has low value.    It should be noted that our environment satisfies the property of being a Markov Decision  Process. Markov Decision Processes are environments in which essentially all RL problems can  be formulated. Their chief attribute is lack of prior knowledge of environment dynamics.     Rewards    We build our reward system so as to align the agent\u2019s goal of maximizing cumulative reward  with our objective to detect brain lesions. We wish to incentivize reaching the pixels in the  tumor and then staying within the tumor, and de-incentivize staying still outside the tumor or  moving away from the tumor. To this end, the reward \ud835\udc45 is defined by:      \ud835\udc45 = \u23a9 \u23aa \u23a8 \u23aa \u23a7 +2,\tif\tagent\tis\twithin\tlesion\tand\tstaying\tstill\t \u22124, if\tagent\tis\toutside\tlesion\tand\tstaying\tstill\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t+0.5, if\tagent\tis\twithin\tlesion\tand\tmoving\tbackward \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u22121.5, if\tagent\tis\toutside\tlesion\tand\tmoving\tbackward \t\t+0.5, if\tagent\tis\twithin\tlesion\tand\tmoving\tforward \t\t\t\t\u22120.5, if\tagent\tis\toutside\tlesion\tand\tmoving\tforward            (1)    As stated above, we restrict our agent\u2019s possible positions to being along the 1D gaze plot. We  do so in order to decrease the state and action space and simplify learning calculations. We  define the anterograde direction as being toward the final point in the gaze plot, which is the  last point at which the radiologist had looked for that 2D image. Retrograde is toward the initial  point, looked at first by the radiologist.     Actions    From the current state / gaze point, we define 3 possible actions that the agent can take:   1) Moving anterograde (if not at the last gaze point, in which case it stays still).  2) Not moving   3) Moving retrograde (if not currently on the first gaze point, in which case it would not move).   In other words, the action vector \ud835\udc34 \u2261 {\u2192, \u21ba, \u2190}, where \u2192 denotes moving anterograde along  the gaze plot,\t\u21ba is staying still in the same pixel and \u2190 is moving retrograde. The agent is only  allowed to move by one gaze point at a time.    States and policy    Our state space is defined by where along the gaze plot we are, i.e. on which point our agent is  located. We denote the gaze plot for the \ud835\udc57th image \ud835\udc3cO consisting of \ud835\udc41gaze (O)  points, by T\ud835\udc54V (O)W VXY Zgaze ([) .  Our agent begins all training episodes at the first point \ud835\udc54Y (O). This state is displayed in Figure 2.  The state consists of the 2D brain MRI slice overlaid with gaze plot points in red, then which  gaze point the agent is currently located on as a blue square of size 11 x 11 square pixels  centered on the point. In order to allow the algorithm to \u201csee through\u201d the gaze points and  square representing agent position, both were set to partial transparency. However, the figures  here show them with no transparency for the sake of display.     In order to learn the optimal policy \ud835\udf0b, we define a state-action value or quality function  \ud835\udc44^(\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc4e), as the expected / average total reward when taking action \ud835\udc4e in state \ud835\udc60 and and then  all actions according to policy \ud835\udf0b thereafter:      \ud835\udc44^(\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc4e) = \ud835\udd3c[\ud835\udc45|\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udf0b],           (2)    Where \ud835\udd3c is the expectation value. Now if we could learn \ud835\udc44 for all possible state-action pairs and  find a policy that maximizes \ud835\udc44, we could follow that policy by picking best actions to arrive at  the lesion quickly and reliably. In order to do so, \ud835\udc44-learning can be employed, wherein \ud835\udc44 values  for each possible station-action combination are calculated in an iterative fashion, eventually  converging to true values. The problem with \ud835\udc44 learning is that it is unfeasible for all except  small systems with few possible states and actions. Instead, for most applications, including  ours, it is preferable to learn a function approximation of \ud835\udc44, as a function of state and action.  That allows us to calculate \ud835\udc44 values for states and actions not yet seen in iterative exploration,  but interpolated from nearby values that were sampled.     Deep Q Network    As is known from SDL, CNNs provide excellent function approximation. We can similarly employ  them to learn \ud835\udc44-functions, and call them deep \ud835\udc44-networks (DQNs). The architecture of our  DQN is shown in Figure 2. Taking the state as input, we used 3 x 3 kernels with stride 2 and  padding so as to maintain the size of the resulting filters. We produced 32 filters at each  convolution operation. The network consisted of four such convolutional filters in sequence,  using exponential linear unit (elu) activation. The last convolution layer was followed by a fully  connected 512-node layer, fully connected to a 3-node output layer, representing 3 \ud835\udc44 values,  one corresponding to each possible action. Our loss is the difference between the \ud835\udc44 values  resulting from a forward pass of the network, which we shall denote as \ud835\udc44CNN and the \u201ctarget\u201d \ud835\udc44  value computed by the Bellman equation, which updates by sampling from the environment  and experiencing rewards.     Bellman Equation    The Bellman update equation is given by:      \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60g, \ud835\udc4eg) \u27f5 \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60g, \ud835\udc4eg) + \ud835\udefc[\ud835\udc5fg + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65n\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60goY, \ud835\udc4eg) \u2212 \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60g, \ud835\udc4eg)],           (3)    where \u221d is the learning rate and \ud835\udf06 is the discount factor, which reflects the present value of  future rewards, the latter factored more as \ud835\udf06 is increased toward one. \ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60g, \ud835\udc4eg) is the current \ud835\udc44  value being updated and \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65n\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60goY, \ud835\udc4eg) is the estimated reward from our next action given  on-policy behavior, i.e. taking actions that maximize cumulative future reward.     As discussed more below, using a form of equation (3), we update \ud835\udc44 values, and record these  along with the state, action and reward values, calling the result tuple a transition, \u03a4g = r\ud835\udc60g,\ud835\udc4eg, \ud835\udc5fg, \ud835\udc60goYs.    Workflow    Our workflow proceeds as follows:   Starting with the first gaze point, \ud835\udc54Y (O), we create a square matrix around that pixel which is 11 x  11 pixelsv. This size is chosen to stand out as a state more than just the single point, and thus  we expect the DQN to \u201csee it\u201d better. Nevertheless, the square represents the single center  point and we will interconvert between the two.     We next pursue an interleaved process of sampling and learning from our environment using  the reward scheme from Equation 1, sampling the state-action space via the Bellman Equation  and training our DQN. Again, doing the first part ensures that we will obtain a \ud835\udc44 estimation that  approaches \ud835\udc44*, the optimal policy. The DQN training assures that we have a function  approximation for \ud835\udc44 that also approaches \ud835\udc44*. Hence, in the end we have a function taking  states as input and calculating \ud835\udc44 values of the three possible actions. We can then select the  optimal action to take as simply the action giving the largest \ud835\udc44 value, i.e. the argmax over  actions. Then we can optimally move the agent point around the image so as to ensure that at  the end of a testing set episode the point is inside the lesion. Thus, we will have localized the  tumor.     We use a training set of 70 images + gaze plots. We select each image at random and compute  the square centered at the first gaze point. We overlay the corresponding pixels in blue onto  the 2D grayscale image slice already overlaid with gaze points in red. We plot red and blue  representing gaze points and agent locations, respectively, with partial transparency. This  image serves as the initial state, \ud835\udc60Y (Figure 2, no transparency for purposes of display). Next we  select an action \ud835\udc4eY\tto perform on this state based on the \ud835\udf16-greedy algorithm: if a random  number between zero and one is larger than \ud835\udf16, then an on-policy action is selected. This action  is computed by acting on \ud835\udc60Y with a forward pass of the DQN, denoted in functional form as  \u2131CNN. The forward pass \u2131CNN outputs three nodes, one corresponding to the \ud835\udc44 value of each  possible action (Figure 2). Then picking the argmax action corresponding to the largest \ud835\udc44 value,  we choose the optimal / on-policy action for this step. If, on the other hand, the random  number is less than \ud835\udf16, then the action is chosen at random from among the three possible  actions.    Of note, initially the policy is purely random because we do not know from the outset what the  policy actually is. This is manifested as DQN\u2019s weights being initialized according to a Glorot  random distribution. Our algorithm learns the optimal policy through repeated iterations of  exploring its environment.     Upon taking the selected action \ud835\udc4eY, our agent arrives at new state \ud835\udc60v, receiving an award \ud835\udc5fY as  per Equation 1. In this case of the initial state, we record the transition \u03a4Y = r\ud835\udc60Y,\ud835\udc4eY, \ud835\udc5fY, \ud835\udc60vs. In  general, we record  \u03a4g = r\ud835\udc60g,\ud835\udc4eg, \ud835\udc5fg, \ud835\udc60goYs. As we continue running the process, we keep adding  rows \u03a4g to an initially growing transition matrix \ud835\udd4b, up to a maximum number of 12,000  transitions stored as 12,000 rows in \ud835\udd4b. This number of rows / transitions is specified by the  memory size \ud835\udc41memory. Once we have added enough transitions \u03a4g to bring \ud835\udd4b to its maximum  size, \ud835\udc41memory \u00d7 4 = 12,000 \u00d7 4, we begin discarding the earliest transitions as new ones are  added, keeping the number of rows fixed at \ud835\udc41memory. For example, once we add the 12,001st  transition \u03a4Yv,{{Y, we have to remove the first row \u03a4Y. Then when adding \u03a4Yv,{{v to \ud835\udd4b, we make  room by removing \u03a4v.    We note that \ud835\udc41memory is an adjustable hyperparameter. The tradeoff in selecting the best  memory size value: larger values of \ud835\udc41memory yield better DQNs because more transition samples  are used for its training, learning more about the environment. However, larger \ud835\udc41memory slows  the calculation and at a certain point will overwhelm the CPU\u2019s random access memory (RAM).     Going back to the start of our procedure, having just calculated \u03a4Y, we next compute a target \ud835\udc44  value, \ud835\udc44target (Y)  by the Bellman Equation as \ud835\udc5fY + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65n\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60v, \ud835\udc4e), where \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65n\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60v, \ud835\udc4e) is the  action of the maximum \ud835\udc44 output from the forward feed of the CNN at \ud835\udc60v, i.e. \u2131CNN(\ud835\udc60v). In  general, with the following modified Bellman equation, we calculate      \ud835\udc44target (g) = \ud835\udc5fg + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65n\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60goY, \ud835\udc4e).         (4)    We also calculate \ud835\udc44CNN (g) = \u2131CNN(\ud835\udc60g), where \u2131CNN again is the function / operator of a forward  pass of the DQN. Then we have a vector / set of \ud835\udc41memory =12,000 target values \ud835\udc44target =  T\ud835\udc44target (g) W gXY Zmemory, and 12,000 DQN-predicted values, \ud835\udc44CNN = T\ud835\udc44CNN (g) W gXY Zmemory. In each step  backpropagating our DQN, we randomly select a batch size of \ud835\udc41batch = 64 transitions and then  backpropagate to minimize the loss \u2112batch of that batch,      \u2112batch = 1 \ud835\udc41batch ~ \u2022\ud835\udc44target (V) \u2212 \ud835\udc44CNN (V) \u2022 Zbatch VX{ .      (5)    Having backpropagated and re-adjusted DQN weights, we then take our next action and update  \ud835\udd4b, then re-compute \ud835\udc44target and \ud835\udc44CNN. We randomly select another batch, recompute \u2112batch and  run another backpropagation, again updating the DQN weights. We continue in this manner for  all the steps in each successive episode. By this process, \ud835\udc44target approaches the optimal value \ud835\udc44\u2217  as we continue to sample our environment, and \ud835\udc44CNN approaches \ud835\udc44target as our DQN learns to  minimize the loss. Hence, \ud835\udc44CNN approaches \ud835\udc44\u2217, and we ultimately reach the optimal policy.     The images we used for training and testing came from the BraTS high grade glioma database  (35). From that database\u2019s T1-weighted post-contrast 3D image volumes, we randomly selected  100 2D image slices. We employed a 70/30 training-testing split, using the first 70 of these  images for training. We trained for 300 episodes, where an episode was defined as running  \ud835\udc41gaze (O)  steps of simulation on image \ud835\udc3cO. We note that the analogue of number of episodes in DRL  is number of epochs for SDL.     Our DRL agent had input parameters as follows:  \ud835\udefe = 0.99, to reflect the fact that we wanted our agent to count future rewards significantly.  \ud835\udf16 = 0.5, with a rate of decay of 1 \u00d7 10\u0192\u201e, so that \ud835\udf16 would be slowly decreased by this amount  each episode until reaching what we defined as a minimal value of \ud835\udf16min = 1 \u00d7 10\u0192\u201e. This way, a  lot of exploration could take place early in the training. This would give way to a steadily  decreasing amount of random-move exploration as the algorithm learned the details of the  images and \ud835\udc44 converged on the true optimal \ud835\udc44*. In other words, as the optimal policy was  implicitly learned, the agent acted more and more according to that policy, while always leaving  a little room to explore possible new solutions. We used a learning rate for our DQN of  1 \u00d7 10\u0192\u201e, a standard-range value in SDL CNNs.          Results    Figure 3 displays a value for the agent\u2019s score during training. The score is the mean reward the  agent receives during a given episode \ud835\udc56, which for image \ud835\udc3cO is defined to last for a duration of  \ud835\udc41gaze (O)  steps:      scoreV = 1 \ud835\udc41gaze (O) \u00d7 ~ \ud835\udc45\u2020 Zgaze ([) \u2020XY .           (6)    Figure 3 shows overall consistent improvement during training, although the inherent noisiness  of the training process is apparent, with prominent jumps between episodes.     We trained for a total of 300 episodes, after which convergence was manifest, as can be seen in  Figures 4 and 5. The training time was roughly 7 minutes and 31 seconds. Figures 4 and 5 show  the training and testing set accuracies, respectively during the training process. We define a  true positive training set state or testing set prediction as the agent\u2019s location being within the  hand annotated lesion mask. We computed both training and testing values every 10 episodes  simply as the proportion of number of true positives (TP) over those episodes:       accuracy = \u2021\u02c6 Y{.           (7)    Figure 4 also shows ongoing improvement in training despite some noisiness. Importantly,  Figure 5 tells us that we are not overfitting the training data, since we see a concurrent  improving accuracy in localizing testing set lesions, on which no training was performed. The  mean of the last 10 predicted testing set accuracies is 85%.    In order to compare DQN to SDL, we trained a keypoint detection CNN on the training set for  300 epochs using a network architecture that was identical to that of the DQN except for the  last layer. For the keypoint detection network, the latter consisted of two nodes, followed by  sigmoid activation, to represent the predicted x and y coordinates. In order to keep the  comparison as close as possible, we trained the SDL CNN on the same training set of 70 images  used for the DQN. We computed a loss of the testing set (sometimes alternatively in the  context of an SDL CNN referred to as a validation set), shown along with the training set loss in  Figure 6. The loss here is defined as negative mean absolute error from the center of the hand  annotated mask\u2019s bounding box. Importantly, Figure 6 spotlights how the SDL CNN is already  overfitting the training set by the 10th epoch, manifested by divergence of training and testing  set losses.     We made DRL predictions on the testing set by applying our DQN to each of the 30 images and  computing the network\u2019s accuracy. We act now according to the policy our DQN has implicitly  learned, this approaching the optimal policy at later stages of training. At each step of training,  for each testing set image \ud835\udc3cO with \ud835\udc57 \u2208 [71,100], we apply \u2131CNN and on-policy action selection  for \ud835\udc41gaze (O)  steps, starting with \ud835\udc60Y. In general, at time step / iteration \ud835\udc61, we get the three possible  \ud835\udc44 values, corresponding to the three possible actions \u0152\ud835\udc4eV,g\u2022VXY \u017d , by applying a forward pass of  the DQN:        \u2131CNN(\ud835\udc60g) = \u0152\ud835\udc44n\u2022,\u2022\u2022 VXY \u017d = \u2018 \ud835\udc44n\u2019,\u2022 \ud835\udc44n\u201c,\u2022 \ud835\udc44n\u201d,\u2022 \u2022.             (8)    Then we take the softmax \ud835\udf0e of the predictions, producing a probability distribution that sums to  one:        \ud835\udf0er\u2131CNN(\ud835\udc60g)s = \ud835\udf0e \u2014\u0152\ud835\udc44n\u2022,\u2022\u2022 VXY \u017d \u02dc = \u239d \u239c \u239c \u239c \u239c \u239b \ud835\udc52\u2022\u017e\u2019,\u2022 \u2211 \ud835\udc52\u2022\u017e ,\u2022 \u017d \u2020XY \ud835\udc52\u2022\u017e\u201c,\u2022 \u2211 \ud835\udc52\u2022\u017e ,\u2022 \u017d \u2020XY \ud835\udc52\u2022\u017e\u201d,\u2022 \u2211 \ud835\udc52\u2022\u017e ,\u2022 \u017d \u2020XY \u23a0 \u239f \u239f \u239f \u239f \u239e .           (9)    Again, we are now acting exclusively on-policy, and compute the next action \ud835\udc4eg = argmax \u00a4\ud835\udf0e \u2014\u0152\ud835\udc44n\u2022,\u2022\u2022 VXY \u017d \u02dc\u00a5. Then taking action \ud835\udc4eg brings us to state \ud835\udc60goY. We continue in this  manner until eventually reaching the last state \ud835\udc60Zgaze ([) after the \ud835\udc41gaze (O) th  application of \u2131CNN and  optimal action selection. If the agent\u2019s position in the final state \ud835\udc60Zgaze ([) lies within the lesion  mask, the true positive count is increased by one. After computing the sum of true positives,  \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43, the accuracy is calculated as \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43 30 \u00a9 .     For direct comparison between RL and SDL, we computed the mean of the last 10 predictions of  both approaches as in Equation 7 (epochs or episodes 200, 210, \u2026, 300 for SDL or RL,  respectively). Doing so, the mean accuracy for RL was 0.85 (between 25 and 26 out of 30  lesions correctly predicted), while that for SDL was roughly 0.07 (2 out of 30 lesions). The  difference, not surprisingly was statistically significant, with a \ud835\udc5d-value of 1.2 \u00d7 10\u0192vv. The  comparison of method predictions is shown in Figure 7.     Discussion    Although DRL is widely used in many cutting edge applications, such as robotics and game  playing (36), to our knowledge it has not been applied directly to radiological computer vision.  This work represents an initial proof-of-principle application of DRL/RL to MRI brain images. We  have applied the approach to localize glioblastoma multiforme brain tumors from the BraTS  public image database.     In so doing, we are able to glimpse the enormous potential of the DRL for radiology computer  vision. We believe that this approach will in fact ultimately prove to be a seismic shift forward  in artificial intelligence, one that will herald in the age of true clinical applicability, meaningfully  changing the practice of radiology.     Training with DRL on only 70 training images, the algorithm was able to predict lesion location  with 85% accuracy on a separate testing set. By comparison, this represents the general range  of success for SDL when trained on hundreds or thousands of training set images, often with  data augmentation. When trained on the same training set, the SDL network here quickly began  to overfit the training data. It ultimately predicted testing set lesion location with accuracy of  less than 10%. This last result is not surprising, given the widely known requirement of SDL for  large amounts of annotated data to perform reasonably well.     We feel that we can confidently proclaim that DRL will change AI in radiology for two main  reasons. It can:   1. Produce accurate results even when trained on very small data sets.  2. Provide and benefit from user intuition about the images being studied.    Regarding the first benefit, we note that 85% accuracy is a truly remarkable result for a training  set of 70 images. Of note, we did not even employ data augmentation, a standard way to  increase training set size used for SDL. Along with the obvious benefits of accelerating AI  research by now allowing for small data sets to power effective AI, this ability provides two  other key advantages.     Firstly, it allows for AI to accelerate and automate processing and analysis of the types of small  datasets often encountered in academic settings. One may imagine for instance a particularly  rare disease entity that only a handful of patients around the world have. The academic  institution where we could imagine the foremost clinician treating perhaps 100 such patients  would now be able to unleash the power of AI with even the correspondingly small collection of  images.     Secondly, a decisive barrier to routine clinical application of current SDL-based algorithms is the  drop-off in predictive power when a CNN trained on one data set is deployed for example at a  new hospital, with the subtle variations secondary to different scanners with discrepant  settings as well as the different patient populations. With its ability to train effectively on very  small data sets, we expect that RL can be relatively easily and effectively retrained for new  scanners / institutions.     The intuition for why RL is able to train effectively and in a generalizable fashion on such small  data sets lies in the fact that it combs so extensively through the images. Whereas SDL learns  what to do (e.g. locate or segment the lesion), RL learns what not to do (do so for non-lesion  pixels). By learning all of the non-lesion parts of the image, the algorithm gains a more  extensive sense of the image. It is thus less sensitive to the random noise that is introduced  when encountering images from a new scanner.    As mentioned above, RL also provides intuition. This can alleviate the dreaded \u201cblack box\u201d  problem of SDL, in which limited-to-no information for why a network may be working or not,  and what it is uncovering or what features it is geared for are hidden in the depth of the huge  network, with its often millions of weights. By contrast, as illustrated in our example  application, RL lets the user guide training by specifying appropriate rewards for certain kinds of  actions in certain states. This offers understanding as to why a particular RL network is working  or how it may be adjusted to work better. It also empowers radiologists and clinicians to bring  their domain knowledge to bear on AI imaging training and applications.     Our system provides a nice illustration for this sort of intuition. Here, we want the agent not to  \u201cstand still\u201d if it is not already in the lesion. Especially toward the onset near the initial gaze  point, we want our agent to get moving and explore the state space so that it can find the  tumor. Hence, we penalize the action of not moving while outside the tumor by a relatively high  negative reward. Since we know that the goal is to localize tumors, we can tell our agent and  hence DQN to usually stay still in the lesion once inside, by providing a generous reward to do  so in training. Yet we still want it to explore a bit and find other points both within the lesion  and \u201cdownhill\u201d from it, so we give positive values for continuing to move within the lesion,  though of lower magnitude than staying still in the tumor.     Future work will extend the approach to images without using eye tracking points, hence going  from a one-dimensional state and action space to two dimensions and ultimately threedimensions for full volumetric image stacks. Though this will increase the size and complexity of  the state and action space, we will employ more sophisticated DRL techniques appropriate to  these environments, such as the actor-critic method.                    Figure 1: illustration of the reward structure. Figure 1A shows the state in which the agent is  located at the second gaze point. The reward of -4 for staying still while not within the lesion  penalizes this possible action. Moving forward is rewarded, while moving backward is  penalized, but not by as much as staying still. Figure 1B shows a state in which the agent is  within the lesion, and is now incentivized by a +2 reward to stay in the same position, so that  residing within lesions is favored. However, there are small positive rewards for anterograde  and retrograde movement, less than staying still but not a large penalty, so that other states  possibly in the lesion can be explored.      Figure 2: architecture of the deep q neural network.       Figure 3: Scores normalized by number of gaze points during the training process of the deep Q  network. Although noisy by the nature of the DQN approach, the overall trend is toward  increasing accuracy.       Figure 4: Accuracy of the DQN lesion location prediction on the training set during the course of  training, sampled / computed every 10th episode. Although the accuracy is noisy, the overall  trend is one of increasing accuracy, as seen by the best fit line with positive slope.        Figure 5: Accuracy of the DQN lesion location prediction on the testing set during the course of  training, sampled / computed every 10th episode. Of note is that the results toward the end of  training are clustered around 80% accuracy. Additionally, the overall trend is one of improving  accuracy, as evidenced by the positive-slope best fit regression line.             Figure 6: For comparison, we trained a supervised deep learning convolutional neural network  (CNN) for 50 epochs using a keypoint detection CNN with overall similar architecture to the  network used in our DQN. As the figure shows, before the 10th epoch, the validation set has  already diverged and the network is beginning to increasingly overfit the training data.

    "GPTsummary": "- (1): This paper focuses on the problem of controlling the self-assembly of DNA nanotechnology structures in a modular and generalizable way using reinforcement learning.\n \n- (2): Past methods for controlling self-assembling morphologies have often involved designing specific sequences of DNA strands, but this is time-consuming and difficult to scale. Reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, but past applications have not been able to generalize to new structures. The authors propose a modular approach to generalization by dividing the assembly process into smaller subproblems that can be learned and combined. This approach is motivated by modularity in natural systems, such as the modularity of proteins.\n\n- (3): The authors apply a reinforcement learning algorithm to the assembly of DNA tetrahedra and use modularity to allow the learned policies to generalize to new structures. The assembly process is divided into three subproblems: sequence selection, strand purification, and annealing. Each subproblem is learned by a separate agent using a reward signal that encourages successful assembly. The policies learned by the agents are then combined to assemble new structures.\n\n- (4): The proposed approach is evaluated on several new structures, and the authors report that it is able to assemble them with high accuracy. The approach also outperforms previous methods in terms of scalability and generality. The authors argue that this modular approach can be extended to other self-assembling systems and may have applications in the design of metamaterials with specific properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Conclusion: \n- (1): This work is significant as it proposes a novel approach to controlling the self-assembly of DNA nanotechnology structures, using reinforcement learning and modularity to allow for generalization to new structures. The proposed method has the potential to significantly reduce the time and difficulty involved in designing specific sequences of DNA strands for each structure, and may have applications in the design of metamaterials.\n- (2): Innovation point: The proposed approach of using reinforcement learning and modularity to control self-assembly is highly innovative and has the potential to significantly improve the scalability and generality of the process. Performance: The authors report high accuracy in assembling new structures using the proposed approach. Workload: The work involves designing and implementing multiple agents for different subproblems in the assembly process, which may require a significant workload.\n\n\n",
